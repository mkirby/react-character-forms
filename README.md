Copy this [API](https://gist.github.com/crutell331/672e1a130ea468198911d9c2c9fabfee) and build an app that has the following:

1. An index listing each character
2. A controlled form to add a new character to the index (non persisting)
3. A controlled form to dynamically filter characters by name

If you finish early tackle one or both of the Bonus suggestions.

### Bonus suggestions:
1. A dropdown that allows you to filter characters by show
2. Ability to list a character as a favorite

### Rules for this assignment:
- You are not allowed to collaborate with your classmates. I want to see how much you are able to complete on your own
- However, you are allowed to ask your instructors for help. Although they will not give you the answer, I've instructed Annie and Chase to be a bit more liberal with how much help they give you for this assignment
- Everyone should submit their work by 12pm and this will count as morning attendance. Even if you haven't completed the assignment you should still submit what you have
- The Study Hall link on the calendar is there to give you a place to easily ask questions to your instructors. Joining is not mandatory since your assignment submission will be your attendance. However, if you want to join and hang out to hear discussions that your classmates are having with your instructors you are welcome to do so. If you'd like to ask us questions 1 on 1 then we'll just jump to a breakout room and then go back to the main room afterward
